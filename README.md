## Overview
___
Milestone project number 2: This is a dashboard showing the current season statistics of teams playing in the English Premiere league. The data is sourced from football-data.org API, and credit to [**Daniel**](https://de.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-freitag/2a/a89/522) for offering this free service. AJAX GET data requests are made and with the correct API authorization key, a json data file is received and then filtered to create the stats dashboard using JavaScript and D3.

## Features
___

### Choosing Soccer League
* When a user first loads the page, defaults league shown is the English Premiere league.
* After that, they have an option to choose a league and see teams statistics in that league.
* To help with reloading page when a user picks a league, browser localStorage is used to keep first the default leauge onload then if a league is chosen the variable holding the localStorage value is updated just before the page reloads and fetching new league data.
* A page loading spinner is used to show data is loading.
* When fetching data is successful, data is rendered on the dashboard. If there was an error an error page is shown.
* The Error thrown is usually a 429 code which means too many requests have been made to the endpoint.
* The [ free endpoint](https://www.football-data.org/pricing) pricing used for this app only allows 10 API calls per minute and if that number is exceeded calls will fail.

### Team Stats
* When the page loads, the **Team Stats** is populated with data for any team selected in the dropdown options list. 
* This list is sorted according to the current league ranking with the last team shown being the team with the least points in the league currently.
* When you select a team from the dropdown, the team badge image changes to match the team selected.
* Team stats for any team is displayed in the cards below the image. When a team name is selected a getSelectedTeam() function is called and data relevant to the team selected is displayed.


### Past 10 Games
* This table shows the last 10 games of a team chosen in the dropdown list, with the latest games shown first. The match dates and scores are also shown.

### Fixtures
* On this table you can see the next upcoming games in the premiere league, also shown is the date the games are set to play. 
* Using the "Pick Match Day" slide, the fixtures table can be rebuilt to show games Finished or Scheduled to play and stating the dates the matches played or to be played. 
* On match day the state on the table will change to "InPlay" when a game kicks off, will show "Paused" during half time and "Finished" when a game end.
* The flags show match day wins, losers and draws. 
```
            Green flag = Winner
            Red flag = Loser
            Blue flag = Draw
```
### Pick Match Day
* As mentioned before, the slide will filter and show game fixtures according to match day picked. 
* The input number shown represents the match day range from 1 to 38, the number of games each team in the league must play in a season.

### Goals Scored Donut
* This donut represents all the teams playing in the league and figures shown are the number of goals each team has scored and mapped to a color to highlight the differences per team.
* If two teams have the same figure D3 maps the teams to the same color. 
* Hovering over the figures shows the team which the color is mapped to as well as the current ranking on the league table

### Goals Conceded Donut
* This donut functionality is the same as the "Goals scored", however this time it shows the number of goals conceded by each team so far.
* The hover effects this time just shows the team which the color and figure represents.

### Team Wins and Team Losses
* These graphs show the number of games each team has won and lost in the season so far respectively. 
* They are listed according to current table rankings and on hover shows the full team name and number of wins or losses.

## Testing
___
> JavaScript Testing

Most of the logic and functionality testing of this project was done using Google Development Tools. 

* Function logic was tested using the Chrome console that would print errors which needed attention if the logic or code syntax did not make sense. 
* With every function written in the stats.js file, troubleshooting the logic of each function was tested and results printed to the console. For example, the first API data request returned a JSON file which had to be filter through by changing json key values to match and display data that was needed.

> API 
* Setup an API [football data account](https://www.football-data.org/client/login), and get an authorization key.
* Used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test and validate API requests and the API key.
* API data filtering [documentaion](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart)
        
        Request URLs used in the project:
        > https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/2021/standing
        > https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/PL/scorers
        > https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/PL/matches



> CSS Testing

* Used the Chrome devtools also to edit the webpage CSS on the fly and then implement the changes on the style.css file.

* Responsive testing was done with the help of flex-box and bootstrap grip templates. Found that bootstrap grids work well with adjusting content to fit in a screen size and adding flex-box and justify-content helped to align containers properly.
* Using the Google development tools, particularly the toggle device toolbar and CSS media queries, the dashboard card adjustments to different mobile screen testing was made easy. 
* CSS validation was tested using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ 

> HTML Testing
* HTMLâ€™s validation was checked using https://validator.w3.org/

## Bugs
___
* Text over-flows and doesn't display properly if the text string is too long when you hover over the Goals Conceded donut, making it hard to read.
* Team badges are not the same size, so some images appear cropped.
* Flags on the fixtures table disappear in mobile view. 

## Deployment
___
* Final version of code was pushed from Cloud9 to a GitHub pages host with all the dependent files included and available for download.
* Final version [URL](https://mrndhlovu.github.io/soccer-leagues-dashboard/)
